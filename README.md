## Frameworks
Frameworks define the structure of how your project is developed. Often, they also provide useful tools to improve your workflow and speed up development.

## Libraries
A library is a collection of operations / functions that a developer can leverage in their project(s). Libraries are not the same as frameworks as they do not enforce structure and are self contained. That is to say, they tend to offer utilities or functionality for one specific category (a math library only provides math functions) and do not branch beyond that.
